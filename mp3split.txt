I just got a mp3 file from a friend yesterday and realized that that the whole album was in one mp3 file. Luckily he send me a cue file with that. So I just installed the mp3splt rpms or deps and of you go:


mp3splt -c file.cue -o @n-@a-@t file.mp3


where:
@n: track number
@a: artist
@t: title

For further info see the man page
