Nautilus-Scripts
OMG!

I just created a package to install a set of nautilus-scripts on several machines... and there is no global installation folder.
There is some discussion going on if this is a good feature. Some people don't think so:

    I am not really convinced that system-wide templates and scripts are a real benefit.
    It might be a good idea, but this feature may be abused by admins or distributors to pollute user menus with un-removable system-wide "enforced" scripts/templates. (1)


I mean wtf? The bad sysadmin is going to spam my nautilus menu...


UPDATE:
For those of you who want to know how to fix this in an rpm:


%post
#ugly hack to get this in all user home dirs
HOMEFOLDERS=`ls /home/ | grep -v lost+found`
for i in $HOMEFOLDERS; do
ln -s /usr/share/nautilus/nautilus-scripts/* /home/$i/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/
done

%postun
#ugly hack to remove this from user home dirs
HOMEFOLDERS=`ls /home/ | grep -v lost+found`
for i in $HOMEFOLDERS; do
rm -rf /home/$i/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts/unprotect-pdf.sh
done


There is even a bug open for this: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68948
