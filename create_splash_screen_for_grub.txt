If you want to create a a customized boot screen for GRUB you actually just need gimp:

   1. create the image you want and scale it to 640x480
      Image --> Scale Image

   2. since we will only use 14 color channels make sure the image does not have to many details

   3. now we adjust the number of color channels to 14. Actually we could use 16, but we reserve 2 channels for the text colors
      Image --> Mode --> Indexed, entering 14 as the "Maximum number of colors"

   4. now we save the image as xpm
      File --> Save As

   5. we gzip the file to make it a bit smaller
      right click --> compress, choose ".gz"

   6. now copy the file to /boot/grub/ (in my case the file is called boot.xpm.gz)

   7. last thing we have to do is changing /etc/grub.conf
      edit this line to contain your image name:
      splashimage=(hd0,0)/grub/boot.xpm.gz


reboot and see you new shiny boot screen
