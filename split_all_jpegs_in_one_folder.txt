While scanning some pages from a book, I was to lazy to scan one page each time, instead I scanned a double page each time and wrote this little script to split the images afterwards. I used it for jpegs, but it should work with most image files with little modifications.


#!/bin/bash

mkdir spliced
for i in $(ls); do
convert $i -crop 100%x50% +repage spliced/`basename $i .JPG`_%d.jpg
mv spliced/`basename $i .JPG`_0.jpg spliced/`basename $i .JPG`_2.jpg
echo "converting $i done"
done
