Creating a custume splash screen for isolinux is really easy. You might want to use this for you boot CD/DVD or PXE boot.
You will need Gimp and the netpbm package

   1. create the image you want and scale it to 640xXXX (should be less or equal 480)
      Image --> Scale Image

   2. since we will only use 14 color channels make sure the image does not have to many details

   3. now we adjust the number of color channels to 14. Actually we could use 16, but we reserve 2 channels for the text colors
      Image --> Mode --> Indexed, entering 14 as the "Maximum number of colors"

   4. now we save the image as gif
      File --> Save As

   5. we need to convert the gif file to a ppm file:
      giftopnm < splash.gif > splash.ppm

   6. and to the final lss file:
      ppmtolss16 < splash.ppm > splash.lss

   7. copy the lss file to the "/isolinux/splash.lss" folder on your boot iso or the pxe boot folder

   8. Now boot up a machine and see you new fany boot screen.
